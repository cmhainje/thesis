	abstract = {It has been suggested that cold dark matter (CDM) has difficulties in explaining tentative evidence for noncuspy halo profiles in small galaxies, and the low velocity dispersions observed in the largest Milky Way satellites ("too big to fail" problem). Strongly self-interacting dark matter has been noted as a robust solution to these problems. The elastic cross sections required are much larger than predicted by generic CDM models, but could naturally be of the right size if dark matter is composite. We explore in a general way the constraints on models where strongly interacting CDM is in the form of dark "atoms" or "molecules," or bound states of a confining gauge interaction ("hadrons"). These constraints include considerations of relic density, direct detection, big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LHC data.},

We briefly discuss the implications of these theories at colliders, especially the (potentially novel) phenomenology of dark mesons in various regimes of the models.

We study the dynamics of self-interacting DM via a light mediator, focusing on the quantum resonant regime where the scattering cross section has a non-trivial velocity dependence. While there are long-standing indications that observations of small scale structure in the Universe are not in accord with the predictions of collisionless DM, theoretical study and simulations of DM self-interactions have focused on parameter regimes with simple analytic solutions for the scattering cross section, with constant or classical velocity (and no angular) dependence. We devise a method that allows us to explore the velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are necessary for the achieving the result. We map out the entire parameter space of DM self-interactions --- and implications for structure observations --- as a function of the coupling and the DM and mediator masses. We derive a new analytic formula for describing resonant s-wave scattering. Finally, we show that DM self-interactions can be correlated with observations of Sommerfeld enhancements in DM annihilation through indirect detection experiments.},

Using detailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that self-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit problem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide diversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles varies across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross section as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle physics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross section, from \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 2{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on galaxy scales to \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 0.1{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits from merging clusters.

Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure
observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of ΛCDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density
profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations.

using a Monte Carlo N-body technique produce halos with significantly
reduced central densities and flatter cores. We introduce a
concentration parameter based on enclosed mass that we expect will be
straightforward to determine observationally and present predictions for
SIDM and CDM. SIDM also produces more spherical halos than CDM,
providing possibly the strongest observational constraint on SIDM. In
our simulations with SIDM cross sections

We compare the structure found in the two cases in which dark matter is treated as collisionless or as a fluid. For the collisionless case, the overall ellipticity of the cluster, the central density cusp, and the amount of surviving substructure are all similar to those found in earlier high-resolution simulations. Collisional dark matter results in a cluster that is more nearly spherical at all radii, has a steeper central density cusp, and has less-but still
substantial-surviving substructure. As in the collisionless case, these results for a ``fluid'' cluster halo are expected to carry over
approximately to smaller mass systems. The observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies then argue that self-interacting dark matter can only be viable if intermediate cross sections produce structure that does not lie between the extremes we have simulated.},

more explore the long (`collisionless') and short (`fluid') mean free

compute the cross-section for producing `extreme' arcs of various sizes.
Even a few collisions per particle modifies the core structure enough to
destroy the ability of the cluster to produce long, thin arcs. For
larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to
unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce
giant arcs. None of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except
the `fluid' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with
the smallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit
of observed cluster masses before it produces radial arcs. Apparently
the elastic collision cross-section of dark matter in clusters must be
very small, below 0.1cm2g-1, to be compatible with
the observed ability of clusters to produce both radial arcs and giant

The dark matter self-interaction would produce isothermal cores in halos and expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs orbiting in large halos. Another consequence of the model is that halos should become spherical once most particles have interacted. Several observations show that the mass distribution in relaxed clusters of galaxies is elliptical. Here, I discuss in particular gravitational lensing in the cluster MS 2137-23, where the ellipticity of the dark matter distribution can be measured to a small radius, r{\textasciitilde}70 kpc, suggesting that most dark matter particles in clusters outside this radius do not collide during the characteristic age of clusters. If true, this implies that any dark matter self-interaction with a cross section independent of velocity is too weak to have affected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies, or to have facilitated the destruction of dwarf satellites in galactic halos.

Cross sections an order of magnitude larger produce sufficient relaxation for rich clusters to develop core radii in the range 100-200 h-1 kpc. The structural evolution of halos is a competition between
collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions and violent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by which clusters grow. Although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size, we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarf galaxies. We find that collision cross sections sufficiently large to significantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores that are too large and/or too round to be
consistent with observation. Thus, the simplest model for
self-interacting dark matter is unable to improve fits to published dwarf galaxy rotation curves without violating other observational constraints.},

Substructure halos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag, which are more rapid and severe than their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction. Lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor of 2 smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detection of tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy Carina suggests that its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs-an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by CDM models but consistent with SIDM models. The orbits of SIDM satellites suffer significant velocity bias, σSIDM/σCDM=0.85, and are more
circular than CDM satellites, βSIDM{\textasciitilde}0.5, in agreement with the inferred orbits of the Galaxy's satellites. In the limit of a short mean free path, SIDM halos have singular isothermal density profiles; thus, in its simplest incarnation SIDM, is inconsistent with galactic rotation curves.},

We derive equilibrium solutions in these SIDM models for the dark matter halo density profile including the gravitational potential of both baryons and dark matter. Self-interactions drive dark matter to be isothermal and this ties the core sizes and shapes of dark matter halos to the spatial distribution of the stars, a radical departure from previous expectations and from cold dark matter predictions. Compared to predictions of SIDM-only simulations, the core sizes are smaller and the core densities are higher, with the largest effects in baryon-dominated galaxies. As an example, we find a core size around 0.3 kpc for dark matter in the Milky Way, more than an order of magnitude smaller than the core size from SIDM-only simulations, which has important
implications for indirect searches of SIDM candidates.},

dark matter (SIDM) on the density profiles and substructure counts of
dark-matter haloes from the scales of spiral galaxies to galaxy
clusters, focusing explicitly on models with cross-sections over
dark-matter particle mass σ/m = 1 and 0.1 cm2
g-1. Our simulations rely on a new SIDM N-body algorithm that
is derived self-consistently from the Boltzmann equation and that
reproduces analytic expectations in controlled numerical experiments. We
find that well-resolved SIDM haloes have constant-density cores, with
significantly lower central densities than their cold dark matter (CDM)
counterparts. In contrast, the subhalo content of SIDM haloes is only
modestly reduced compared to CDM, with the suppression greatest for
large hosts and small halo-centric distances. Moreover, the large-scale
clustering and halo circular velocity functions in SIDM are effectively
identical to CDM, meaning that all of the large-scale successes of CDM
are equally well matched by SIDM. From our largest cross-section runs,
we are able to extract scaling relations for core sizes and central
densities over a range of halo sizes and find a strong correlation
between the core radius of an SIDM halo and the NFW scale radius of its
CDM counterpart. We construct a simple analytic model, based on CDM
scaling relations, that captures all aspects of the scaling relations
for SIDM haloes. Our results show that halo core densities in σ/m
= 1 cm2 g-1 models are too low to match
observations of galaxy clusters, low surface brightness spirals (LSBs)
and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. However, SIDM with σ/m ≃ 0.1
cm2 g-1 appears capable of reproducing reported
core sizes and central densities of dwarfs, LSBs and galaxy clusters
without the need for velocity dependence. Higher resolution simulations
over a wider range of masses will be required to confirm this
expectation. We discuss constraints arising from the Bullet cluster
observations, measurements of dark-matter density on small scales and
subhalo survival requirements, and show that SIDM models with σ/m
≃ 0.1 cm2 g-1 ≃ 0.2 barn
GeV-1 are consistent with all observational constraints.},

	abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some
advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

has used this effect to rule out velocity-independent, elastic
cross-sections larger than σ/m ≃ 0.02 cm2
g-1 based on comparisons to the shapes of galaxy cluster
lensing potentials and X-ray isophotes. In this paper, we use
cosmological simulations to show that these constraints were off by more
than an order of magnitude because (a) they did not properly account for
the fact that the observed ellipticity gets contributions from the
triaxial mass distribution outside the core set by scatterings, (b) the
scatter in axis ratios is large and (c) the core region retains more of
its triaxial nature than estimated before. Including these effects
properly shows that the same observations now allow dark matter
self-interaction cross-sections at least as large as σ/m = 0.1
cm2 g-1. We show that constraints on
self-interacting dark matter from strong-lensing clusters are likely to
improve significantly in the near future, but possibly more via central
densities and core sizes than halo shapes.},

dark matter paradigm only if it is able to substantially reduce the
central densities of dwarf-size haloes while keeping the densities and
shapes of cluster-size haloes within current constraints. Given the
seemingly stringent nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a
decade that self-interacting dark matter would be viable only if the
cross-section for self-scattering was strongly velocity dependent.
However, it has recently been suggested that a constant cross-section
per unit mass of σT/m ∼ 0.1 cm2
g-1 is sufficient to accomplish the desired effect. We
explicitly investigate this claim using high-resolution cosmological
simulations of a Milky Way-size halo and find that, similarly to the
cold dark matter case, such cross-section produces a population of
massive subhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the
classical dwarf spheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of
the mass profiles of Fornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if
σT/m ∼ 1 cm2 g-1 at the dwarf
spheroidal scales. Since this value is likely inconsistent with the halo
shapes of several clusters, our results leave only a small window open
for a velocity-independent self-interacting dark matter model to work as
a distinct alternative to cold dark matter.},

simulations. Each halo has millions of particles within its virial
radius. We find that SIDM models with cross-sections per unit mass
spanning the range σ/m = 0.5-50 cm2 g-1
alleviate TBTF and produce constant-density cores of size 300-1000 pc,
comparable to the half-light radii of M⋆ ∼ 105

develop for cross-sections in the middle of this range, σ/m ∼
5-10 cm2 g-1. Our largest SIDM cross-section run
(σ/m = 50 cm2 g-1) develops a slightly
denser core owing to mild core-collapse behaviour, but it remains less
dense than the cold dark matter case and retains a constant-density core
profile. Our work suggests that SIDM cross-sections as large or larger
than 50 cm2 g-1 remain viable on velocity scales
of dwarf galaxies (vrms ∼ 40 km s-1). The
range of SIDM cross-sections that alleviate TBTF and the cusp/core
problem spans at least two orders of magnitude and therefore need not be
particularly fine-tuned.},
