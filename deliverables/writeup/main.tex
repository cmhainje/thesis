\chapter*{Abstract}

I present a novel test of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models by
analyzing the impact of self-interaction on the infall of the Sagittarius
(Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.  A review of the history of dark matter
detections and the development of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is
included, followed by a review of the motivations for and viability of SIDM
models. Sgr is then presented as a testbed for these models, since its unique
orbital history is highly sensitive to the microphysics determining the Galactic
gravitational potential. I present three simulations of the Sgr infall: two
using collisionless dark matter with cuspy and cored initial galactic profiles,
and one using self-interacting dark matter.  It is found that the inclusion of
dark matter self-interaction has profound impacts on the resulting shape and
distribution of the Sgr stream.  In particular, we find that the distribution of
radial velocities is impacted substantially, with the SIDM merger unable to
reconcile both the shape of the stream and the observed radial velocity of the
progenitor.
