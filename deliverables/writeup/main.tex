\chapter*{Abstract}

I present a novel test of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models by
analyzing the impact of self-interaction on the infall of the Sagittarius
(Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.  A review of the history of dark matter
detections and the development of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is
included, followed by a review of the motivations for and viability of SIDM
models. Sgr is then presented as a testbed for these models, since its unique
orbital history is highly sensitive to the microphysics determining the Galactic
gravitational potential. I present three simulations of the Sgr infall: two
using collisionless dark matter with cuspy and cored initial galactic profiles,
and one using self-interacting dark matter.  It is found that the inclusion of
dark matter self-interaction has profound impacts on the resulting shape and
distribution of the Sgr stream.
