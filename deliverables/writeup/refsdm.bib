	doi = {10.1086/177173},
	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

rotation curves expected in the tidal torque theory of angular momentum,
in which (lambda) is about 0.05. For F of about 0.05 the dispersion in
lambda expected in the tidal torque theory, 0.02-0.1, leads to rotation
curves for bright galaxies whose systematics are much like those of

supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The
distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater}= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0
{\textless} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {\textgreater}= 0.},

universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at
redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8ΩM-0.6ΩΛ{\textasciitilde}-0.2+/-0.1
in the region of interest (ΩM{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.5). For a flat
(ΩM+ΩΛ=1) cosmology we find
ΩflatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 σ statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified
systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Λ=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ{\textgreater}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties.
The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is
tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift
Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes.

∼1011M⊙, the theory faces a number of
challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naïvely predicted in ΛCDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with ΛCDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of ΛCDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the ΛCDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most
metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and
theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns,
structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: In most cases, the stellar velocity
dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic
uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project,
for M* ∼ 104-11 M⊙ galaxies in
Mh ∼ 109-12 M⊙ haloes. FIRE
incorporates explicit stellar feedback in the multiphase interstellar
medium, with energetics from stellar population models. We find that
stellar feedback, without `fine-tuned' parameters, greatly alleviates
small-scale problems in CDM. Feedback causes bursts of star formation
and outflows, altering the DM distribution. As a result, the inner slope
of the DM halo profile (α) shows a strong mass dependence:
profiles are shallow at Mh ∼
1010-1011 M⊙ and steepen at
higher/lower masses. The resulting core sizes and slopes are consistent
with observations. This is broadly consistent with previous work using
simpler feedback schemes, but we find steeper mass dependence of
α, and relatively late growth of cores. Because the star formation
efficiency M*/Mh is strongly halo mass dependent,
a rapid change in α occurs around Mh ∼
1010 M⊙ (M* ∼
106-107 M⊙), as sufficient feedback
energy becomes available to perturb the DM. Large cores are not
established during the period of rapid growth of haloes because of
ongoing DM mass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of
star formation after the rapid build-up has completed. Stellar feedback
dramatically reduces circular velocities in the inner kpc of massive
dwarfs; this could be sufficient to explain the `Too Big To Fail'
problem without invoking non-standard DM. Finally, feedback and baryonic
contraction in Milky Way-mass haloes produce DM profiles slightly
shallower than the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, consistent with the
normalization of the observed Tully-Fisher relation.},

energetic feedback generates large underdense bubbles of expanding gas from centrally concentrated bursts of star formation. The model
demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation, breaks with the reliance on adiabatic
approximations which are inappropriate in the rapidly changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic fountains can give rise to cusp flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryons form stars. Dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. The model suggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts or active galactic nucleus phases are sufficiently frequent and energetic.},

This is in marked contrast to the well-established monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massive haloes. We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco. It may be possible to
circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhaloes by order unity on a scale of 0.3-1 kpc.},

measurements of the microwave background anisotropies by observations of
galaxy clustering, and by the observed streaming motions of galaxies.
When normalized to match the COBE results, models with Omega = 1 and
with more large-scale power than the standard cold dark matter (CDM)
model predict lower streaming motions than are observed, but agree well
with the dynamics of clustering on smaller scales. Unbiased Omega = 1
CDM models fit the COBE data and the streaming motions, but are less
easily reconciled with galaxy clustering data on either small or large
scales. Spatially flat CDM models with Omega of about 0.2 and a
cosmological constant require the mass to be substantially more
clustered than the galaxies in order to be consistent with COBE and with
observed streaming motions. They are then in conflict, however, with
dynamical measurements on smaller scales.},

	abstract = {We present full-sky microwave maps in five frequency bands (23-94 GHz) 
from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year sky
survey. Calibration errors are less than 0.5\%, and the low systematic
error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is
separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps
are consistent with the 7° FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)
maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole
values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with
-58NL{\textless}134 (95\% confidence level [CL]). The
2{\textless}=l{\textless}=900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for
l{\textless}354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to l=658.
The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic
features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical
depth of reionization is τ=0.17+/-0.04, which implies a reionization
epoch of tr=180+220-80 Myr (95\% CL)
after the big bang at a redshift of
zr=20+10-9 (95\% CL) for a range of
ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the
presence of a significant warm dark matter density.

A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of
large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters.
The age of the best-fit universe is t0=13.7+/-0.2 Gyr.
Decoupling was tdec=379+8-7 kyr after
the big bang at a redshift of zdec=1089+/-1. The thickness of
the decoupling surface was Δzdec=195+/-2. The matter
density of the universe is
Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009,
the baryon density is Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009,
and the total mass-energy of the universe is
Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02. It appears that there may be
progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to
fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Lyα
forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of
scalar fluctuations, fitted as ns=0.93+/-0.03 at wavenumber
k0=0.05 Mpc-1 (leff{\textasciitilde}700), with a slope
of dns/dlnk=-0.031+0.016-0.018 in the
best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, ns=0.99+/-0.04.) This
flat universe model is composed of 4.4\% baryons, 22\% dark matter, and
73\% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to
w{\textless}-0.78 (95\% CL). Inflation theory is supported with ns{\textasciitilde}1,
Ωtot{\textasciitilde}1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy,
and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization
anticorrelations at decoupling. An admixture of isocurvature modes does
not improve the fit. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is
r(k0=0.002Mpc-1){\textless}0.90 (95\% CL). The lack of CMB
fluctuation power on the largest angular scales reported by COBE and
confirmed by WMAP is intriguing. WMAP continues to operate, so results
will improve.

WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the
WMAP Science Team.},

Its performance is well in line with expectations, and it will continue to gather scientific data until the end of its cryogenic lifetime. We give an overview of the history of Planck in its first year of operations, and describe some of the key performance aspects of the satellite. This paper is part of a package submitted in conjunction with Planck's Early Release Compact Source Catalogue, the first data product based on Planck to be released publicly. The package describes the scientific performance of the Planck payload, and presents results on a variety of astrophysical topics related to the sources included in the Catalogue, as well as selected topics on diffuse emission.
