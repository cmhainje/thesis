	abstract = {The extensive span of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream makes it a promising tool for studying the Milky Way gravitational potential. Characterizing its stellar kinematics can constrain halo properties and provide a benchmark for the Cold Dark Matter galaxy formation paradigm. Accurate models of the disruption dynamics of the Sgr progenitor are necessary to employ this tool. Using a combination of analytic modeling and N-body simulations, we build a new model of the Sgr orbit and resulting stellar stream. In contrast to previous models, we simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time it first crossed the Milky Way virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the parameter space of initial phase-space conditions yields tight constraints on the angular momentum of the Sgr progenitor. Our best-fit model is the first to reproduce accurately existing data on the 3D positions and radial velocities of the debris detected 100 kpc away in the MW halo. In addition to replicating the mapped stream, the simulation also predicts the existence of several arms of the Sgr stream extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs. The two most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo coincide with the predicted structure. Additional stars in the newly predicted arms can be found with future data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Detecting a statistical sample of stars in the most distant Sgr arms would provide an opportunity to constrain the Milky Way potential out to unprecedented Galactocentric radii.},

	abstract = {We present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas disks based on the assumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

Strongly self-interacting dark matter has been noted as a robust solution to these problems. The elastic cross sections required are much larger than predicted by generic CDM models, but could naturally be of the right size if dark matter is composite. We explore in a general way the constraints on models where strongly interacting CDM is in the form of dark "atoms" or "molecules," or bound states of a confining gauge interaction ("hadrons"). These constraints include considerations of relic density, direct detection, big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LHC data.},

We study the dynamics of self-interacting DM via a light mediator, focusing on the quantum resonant regime where the scattering cross section has a non-trivial velocity dependence. While there are long-standing indications that observations of small scale structure in the Universe are not in accord with the predictions of collisionless DM, theoretical study and simulations of DM self-interactions have focused on parameter regimes with simple analytic solutions for the scattering cross section, with constant or classical velocity (and no angular) dependence. We devise a method that allows us to explore the velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are necessary for the achieving the result. We map out the entire parameter space of DM self-interactions --- and implications for structure observations --- as a function of the coupling and the DM and mediator masses. We derive a new analytic formula for describing resonant s-wave scattering. Finally, we show that DM self-interactions can be correlated with observations of Sommerfeld enhancements in DM annihilation through indirect detection experiments.},

Using detailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that self-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit problem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide diversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles varies across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross section as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle physics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross section, from \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 2{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on galaxy scales to \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 0.1{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits from merging clusters. Our results dramatically improve the constraints on SIDM models and may allow the masses of both DM and dark mediator particles to be measured even if the dark sector is completely hidden from the Standard Model, which we illustrate for the dark photon model.},

The models can serve as initial conditions for simulations of isolated galaxies that include both hydrodynamics and collisionless dynamics. We test the code by evolving a pair of simple gas disc-halo models, which differ only in the initial temperature of the gas component. The models are similar to the ones considered in the Wang et al. except that here, the halo is live whereas they included the halo as a fixed potential. We find that the basic structural properties of the models, such as the rotation curve and surface density profiles, are well-preserved over 1.5 Gyr. We also construct a Milky Way model that includes thin and thick stellar disc components, a gas disc, a bulge, and a dark halo. Bar formation occurs in all disc-like components at about 1 Gyr. The bar is strongest in the thin disc while the gas disc contains the most prominent spiral features. The length of the bar in our model is comparable to what has been inferred for the Galactic bar.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

The model is specified by a phase space distribution function which, in turn, depends on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 10{\textasciicircum}5 models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability distribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the Sersic index of the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We also calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter velocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for terrestrial dark matter detection experiments. Though the Milky Way models in our chain all satisfy the prescribed observational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters and therefore respond differently to non-axisymmetric perturbations. We simulate the evolution of twenty-five models which have different Toomre Q and Goldreich-Tremaine X parameters. Virtually all of these models form a bar, though some, more quickly than others. The bar pattern speeds are {\textasciitilde} 40 - 50 km/s/kpc at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to coupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed {\textasciitilde}50 km/s/kpc we conclude that it must have formed recently.},

	doi = {10.1086/177173},
	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure
observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of ΛCDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density
profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations.

supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The
distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater}= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0
{\textless} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {\textgreater}= 0.},

universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at
redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8ΩM-0.6ΩΛ{\textasciitilde}-0.2+/-0.1
in the region of interest (ΩM{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.5). For a flat
(ΩM+ΩΛ=1) cosmology we find
ΩflatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 σ statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified
systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Λ=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ{\textgreater}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties.
The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is
tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift
Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes.

∼1011M⊙, the theory faces a number of
challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naïvely predicted in ΛCDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with ΛCDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of ΛCDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the ΛCDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most
metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and
theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns,
structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: In most cases, the stellar velocity
dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic
uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

for M* ∼ 104-11 M⊙ galaxies in
Mh ∼ 109-12 M⊙ haloes. FIRE
incorporates explicit stellar feedback in the multiphase interstellar
medium, with energetics from stellar population models. We find that
stellar feedback, without `fine-tuned' parameters, greatly alleviates
small-scale problems in CDM. Feedback causes bursts of star formation
and outflows, altering the DM distribution. As a result, the inner slope
of the DM halo profile (α) shows a strong mass dependence:
profiles are shallow at Mh ∼
1010-1011 M⊙ and steepen at
higher/lower masses. The resulting core sizes and slopes are consistent
with observations. This is broadly consistent with previous work using
simpler feedback schemes, but we find steeper mass dependence of
α, and relatively late growth of cores. Because the star formation
efficiency M*/Mh is strongly halo mass dependent,
a rapid change in α occurs around Mh ∼
1010 M⊙ (M* ∼
106-107 M⊙), as sufficient feedback
energy becomes available to perturb the DM. Large cores are not
established during the period of rapid growth of haloes because of
ongoing DM mass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of
star formation after the rapid build-up has completed. Stellar feedback
dramatically reduces circular velocities in the inner kpc of massive
dwarfs; this could be sufficient to explain the `Too Big To Fail'
problem without invoking non-standard DM. Finally, feedback and baryonic
contraction in Milky Way-mass haloes produce DM profiles slightly
shallower than the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, consistent with the
normalization of the observed Tully-Fisher relation.},

energetic feedback generates large underdense bubbles of expanding gas from centrally concentrated bursts of star formation. The model
demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation, breaks with the reliance on adiabatic
approximations which are inappropriate in the rapidly changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic fountains can give rise to cusp flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryons form stars. Dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. The model suggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts or active galactic nucleus phases are sufficiently frequent and energetic.},

using a Monte Carlo N-body technique produce halos with significantly
reduced central densities and flatter cores. We introduce a
concentration parameter based on enclosed mass that we expect will be
straightforward to determine observationally and present predictions for
SIDM and CDM. SIDM also produces more spherical halos than CDM,
providing possibly the strongest observational constraint on SIDM. In
our simulations with SIDM cross sections

For the collisionless case, the overall ellipticity of the cluster, the central density cusp, and the amount of surviving substructure are all similar to those found in earlier high-resolution simulations. Collisional dark matter results in a cluster that is more nearly spherical at all radii, has a steeper central density cusp, and has less-but still
substantial-surviving substructure. As in the collisionless case, these results for a ``fluid'' cluster halo are expected to carry over
approximately to smaller mass systems. The observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies then argue that self-interacting dark matter can only be viable if intermediate cross sections produce structure that does not lie between the extremes we have simulated.},

galaxy cluster, to study how its ability to produce giant
gravitationally lensed arcs is influenced by the collision cross-section
of its dark matter. In three cases typical dark matter particles in the
cluster core undergo between 1 and 100 collisions per Hubble time; two
more explore the long (`collisionless') and short (`fluid') mean free
path limits. We study the size and shape distributions of arcs and
compute the cross-section for producing `extreme' arcs of various sizes.
Even a few collisions per particle modifies the core structure enough to
destroy the ability of the cluster to produce long, thin arcs. For
larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to
unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce
giant arcs. None of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except
the `fluid' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with
the smallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit
of observed cluster masses before it produces radial arcs. Apparently
the elastic collision cross-section of dark matter in clusters must be
very small, below 0.1cm2g-1, to be compatible with
the observed ability of clusters to produce both radial arcs and giant
arcs.},

The dark matter self-interaction would produce isothermal cores in halos and expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs orbiting in large halos. Another consequence of the model is that halos should become spherical once most particles have interacted. Several observations show that the mass distribution in relaxed clusters of galaxies is elliptical. Here, I discuss in particular gravitational lensing in the cluster MS 2137-23, where the ellipticity of the dark matter distribution can be measured to a small radius, r{\textasciitilde}70 kpc, suggesting that most dark matter particles in clusters outside this radius do not collide during the characteristic age of clusters. If true, this implies that any dark matter self-interaction with a cross section independent of velocity is too weak to have affected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies, or to have facilitated the destruction of dwarf satellites in galactic halos.

We show that a few collisions per particle per Hubble time at halo center can substantially affect the central density profile. Cross sections an order of magnitude larger produce sufficient relaxation for rich clusters to develop core radii in the range 100-200 h-1 kpc. The structural evolution of halos is a competition between
collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions and violent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by which clusters grow. Although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size, we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarf galaxies. We find that collision cross sections sufficiently large to significantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores that are too large and/or too round to be
consistent with observation. Thus, the simplest model for
self-interacting dark matter is unable to improve fits to published dwarf galaxy rotation curves without violating other observational constraints.},

Substructure halos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag, which are more rapid and severe than their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction. Lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor of 2 smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detection of tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy Carina suggests that its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs-an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by CDM models but consistent with SIDM models. The orbits of SIDM satellites suffer significant velocity bias, σSIDM/σCDM=0.85, and are more
circular than CDM satellites, βSIDM{\textasciitilde}0.5, in agreement with the inferred orbits of the Galaxy's satellites.

Compared to predictions of SIDM-only simulations, the core sizes are smaller and the core densities are higher, with the largest effects in baryon-dominated galaxies.

dark-matter haloes from the scales of spiral galaxies to galaxy
clusters, focusing explicitly on models with cross-sections over
dark-matter particle mass σ/m = 1 and 0.1 cm2
g-1. Our simulations rely on a new SIDM N-body algorithm that
is derived self-consistently from the Boltzmann equation and that
reproduces analytic expectations in controlled numerical experiments. We
find that well-resolved SIDM haloes have constant-density cores, with
significantly lower central densities than their cold dark matter (CDM)
counterparts. In contrast, the subhalo content of SIDM haloes is only
modestly reduced compared to CDM, with the suppression greatest for
large hosts and small halo-centric distances. Moreover, the large-scale
clustering and halo circular velocity functions in SIDM are effectively
identical to CDM, meaning that all of the large-scale successes of CDM
are equally well matched by SIDM. From our largest cross-section runs,
we are able to extract scaling relations for core sizes and central
densities over a range of halo sizes and find a strong correlation
between the core radius of an SIDM halo and the NFW scale radius of its
CDM counterpart. We construct a simple analytic model, based on CDM
scaling relations, that captures all aspects of the scaling relations
for SIDM haloes. Our results show that halo core densities in σ/m
= 1 cm2 g-1 models are too low to match
observations of galaxy clusters, low surface brightness spirals (LSBs)
and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. However, SIDM with σ/m ≃ 0.1
cm2 g-1 appears capable of reproducing reported
core sizes and central densities of dwarfs, LSBs and galaxy clusters
without the need for velocity dependence. Higher resolution simulations
over a wider range of masses will be required to confirm this
expectation. We discuss constraints arising from the Bullet cluster
observations, measurements of dark-matter density on small scales and
subhalo survival requirements, and show that SIDM models with σ/m

The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some
advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'.

cosmological simulations to show that these constraints were off by more

the fact that the observed ellipticity gets contributions from the
triaxial mass distribution outside the core set by scatterings, (b) the
scatter in axis ratios is large and (c) the core region retains more of
its triaxial nature than estimated before. Including these effects
properly shows that the same observations now allow dark matter
self-interaction cross-sections at least as large as σ/m = 0.1

seemingly stringent nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a
decade that self-interacting dark matter would be viable only if the
cross-section for self-scattering was strongly velocity dependent.
However, it has recently been suggested that a constant cross-section
per unit mass of σT/m ∼ 0.1 cm2
g-1 is sufficient to accomplish the desired effect. We
explicitly investigate this claim using high-resolution cosmological
simulations of a Milky Way-size halo and find that, similarly to the
cold dark matter case, such cross-section produces a population of
massive subhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the
classical dwarf spheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of
the mass profiles of Fornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if
σT/m ∼ 1 cm2 g-1 at the dwarf
spheroidal scales. Since this value is likely inconsistent with the halo
shapes of several clusters, our results leave only a small window open

These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model of the Sgr dwarf's orbit that enables us to explore a wider parameter space than is accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant data on the Sgr dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital histories. At one extreme the Sgr dwarf initially possesses

At the other extreme the Sgr dwarf starts with {\textasciitilde}109Msolar and RD(0){\textasciitilde}60kpc, similar to its present apocentric distance. In all cases the Sgr dwarf is initially dark matter dominated and the current velocity dispersion of the Sgr dwarf's dark matter is tightly constrained to be

	abstract = {We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy 
mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS). Near-infrared photometry of Sgr's prominent M-giant
population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of Sgr.
The main body is fitted with a King profile of limiting major-axis
radius 30°-substantially larger than previously found or
assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from
stars in the Sgr tidal tails; thus the Sgr radial profile resembles that
of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting traditional
methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the brightness
of the main body of Sgr to be MV=-13.27 (the brightest of the
known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to
be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with
suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the
King-fit core radius (224') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius
as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic
disruption during its last orbits. The M-giant distribution of Sgr
exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to,
the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54. A striking trailing
tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc across the
south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean
distance varying from {\textasciitilde}20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading debris arm
extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an
apogalacticon {\textasciitilde}45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the north
Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the Galactic
plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes, covers the
NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital
plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies within a kiloparsec of
that plane and near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, it is possible
that former Sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood. We discuss
the implications of this new view of the Sgr galaxy and its entrails for
the character of the Sgr orbit, mass, mass-loss rate, and contribution
of stars to the Milky Way halo. The minimal precession displayed by the
Sgr tidal debris along its inclined orbit supports the notion of a
nearly spherical Galactic potential. The number of M giants in the Sgr
tails is at least 15\% that contained within the King limiting radius of
the main Sgr body. The fact that M giants, presumably formed within the
past few gigayears in the Sgr nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread
along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of
these arms but also poses a timing problem that bears on the recent
binding energy of the Sgr core and that is most naturally explained by
recent and catastrophic mass loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than
75\% of the high-latitude, halo M giants, despite substantial reservoirs
of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant
tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good
correspondence is found between the M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr
system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris,
with the exception of Sgr carbon stars, which must be subluminous
compared with counterparts in other Galactic satellites in order to
resolve the discrepancy.},

	abstract = {We present a new N-body model for the tidal disruption of the 
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the
majority of angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints
imposed by current wide-field surveys of its dynamically young (lsim3
Gyr) tidal debris streams. In particular, this model resolves the
conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr
leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years. While
the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the
leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that this
bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the
Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the
success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric
component to the Galactic gravitational potential that can be described
in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio
(c/a)Φ = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio
(b/a)Φ = 0.99 at radii 20 kpc {\textless} r {\textless} 60 kpc. The
minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l,
b) = (7°, 0°), (0°, 90°), and (97°, 0°)
respectively, corresponding to a nearly oblate ellipsoid whose minor
axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. This particular
disk/halo orientation is difficult to reconcile within the general
context of galactic dynamics (and cold dark matter models in
particular), suggesting either that the orientation may have evolved
significantly with time or that inclusion of other non-axisymmetric
components (such as the gravitational influence of the Magellanic
Clouds) in the model may obviate the need for triaxiality in the dark
matter halo. The apparent proper motion of Sgr in this model is
estimated to be (μ l cos b, μ b ) = (-2.16,
1.73) mas yr-1, corresponding to a Galactocentric space
velocity (U, V, W) = (230, -35, 195) km s-1 . Based on the
velocity dispersion in the stellar tidal streams, we estimate that Sgr
has a current bound mass M Sgr = 2.5+1.3
-1.0 × 108 M sun. We demonstrate
that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of Sgr,
tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the
metallicity distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams
similar to those observed in recent studies. These models predict a
strong evolution in the MDF of the model Sgr dwarf with time, indicating
that the chemical abundances of stars in Sgr at the present day may be
significantly different than the abundances of those already contributed
to the Galactic stellar halo. We conclude by using the new N-body model
to re-evaluate previous claims of the association of miscellaneous halo
substructure with the Sgr dwarf.},

Moreover, we show that the internal rotation of the progenitor may strongly alter the location of the leading tail projected on the sky, and thus affect the constraints on the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo that may be derived from modelling the Sgr stream. Our models provide a clear, easily tested prediction; although tidal mass stripping removes a large fraction of the original angular momentum in the progenitor dwarf galaxy, the remnant core should still rotate with a velocity amplitude {\textasciitilde}20kms-1 that could be readily detected in future, wide-field kinematic surveys of the Sgr dwarf.},

in the formation of spiral arms, influences the central bar and produces
a flared outer disk. Two ring-like wrappings emerge towards the Galactic
anti-Centre in our model that are reminiscent of the low-latitude arcs
observed in the same area of the Milky Way. Previous models have focused
on Sgr itself to reproduce the dwarf's orbital history and place
associated constraints on the shape of the Milky Way gravitational
potential, treating the Sgr impact event as a trivial influence on the
Galactic disk. Our results show that the Milky Way's morphology is not
purely secular in origin and that low-mass minor mergers predicted to be
common throughout the Universe probably have a similarly important role
in shaping galactic structure.},

(LMC) could be significantly more massive than previously thought, we
explore whether the approximation of an inertial Galactocentric
reference frame is still valid in the presence of such a massive LMC. We
find that previous estimates of the LMC’s orbital period and
apocentric distance derived assuming a fixed Milky Way (MW) are
significantly shortened for models where the MW is allowed to move
freely in response to the gravitational pull of the LMC. Holding other
parameters fixed, the fraction of models favoring first infall is
reduced. Due to this interaction, the MW center of mass within the inner
50 kpc can be significantly displaced in phase-space in a very short
period of time that ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 Gyr by as much as 30 kpc and
75 km s-1. Furthermore, we show that the gravitational
pull of the LMC and response of the MW are likely to significantly
affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal debris from the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than previous
estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr
deposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the
present-day Sgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly
accounting for the movement of the MW around its common center of mass
with the LMC significantly modifies the angular distance between
apocenters and tilts its orbital pole, alleviating tensions between
previous models and observations. While these models are preliminary in
nature, they highlight the central importance of accounting for the
mutual gravitational interaction between the MW and LMC when modeling
the kinematics of objects in the MW and Local Group.},

Our study presents new Sgr debris detections, accurate distances and line-of-sight velocities that together help to shed new light on the puzzle of the Sgr tails. For both the leading and the trailing tails, we trace the points of their maximal extent, or apocentric distances, and find that they lie at RL = 47.8 ± 0.5 kpc and
RT = 102.5 ± 2.5 kpc, respectively. The angular
difference between the apocentres is 93.2° ± 3.5°, which
is smaller than predicted for logarithmic haloes. Such differential orbital precession can be made consistent with models of the Milky Way in which the dark matter density falls more quickly with radius. However, currently, no existing Sgr disruption simulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. Based on its position and radial velocity, we show that the unusually large globular cluster NGC 2419 can be associated with the Sgr trailing stream. We measure the precession of the orbital plane of the Sgr debris in the Milky Way potential and show that, surprisingly, Sgr debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolves differently from the secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.},

Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {\textless} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding
uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1,
respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({\textless} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {We have designed a powerful new algorithm to detect stellar streams in an automated and systematic way. The algorithm, which we call the STREAMFINDER, is well suited for finding dynamically cold and thin stream structures that may lie along any simple or complex orbits in Galactic stellar surveys containing any combination of positional and kinematic information. In the present contribution, we introduce the algorithm, lay out the ideas behind it, explain the methodology adopted to detect streams, and detail its workings by running it on a suite of simulations of mock Galactic survey data of similar quality to that expected from the European Space Agency/Gaia mission. We show that our algorithm is able to detect even ultra-faint stream features lying well below previous detection limits. Tests show that our algorithm will be able to detect distant halo stream structures \&gt;10° long containing as few as ∼15 members (ΣG ∼ 33.6 mag arcsec−2) in the Gaia data set.},

M⊙. Unless the Milky Way is a statistical anomaly, this implies that galaxy formation becomes effectively stochastic at these masses. This is in marked contrast to the well-established monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massive haloes. We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco. It may be possible to
circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhaloes by order unity on a scale of 0.3-1 kpc.},

CDM models fit the COBE data and the streaming motions, but are less
easily reconciled with galaxy clustering data on either small or large
scales. Spatially flat CDM models with Omega of about 0.2 and a
cosmological constant require the mass to be substantially more
clustered than the galaxies in order to be consistent with COBE and with
observed streaming motions. They are then in conflict, however, with
dynamical measurements on smaller scales.},

 M⊙ haloes of collisionless cold dark matter (CDM)

These cosmological zoom-in simulations are part of the Feedback In
Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and utilize the FIRE-2 model for
hydrodynamics and galaxy formation physics. We find the stellar masses
of the galaxies formed in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with
σ/m = 1 cm2 g-1 are very similar to those in
CDM (spanning M⋆ ≈
105.7-7.0M⊙) and all runs lie on a similar
stellar mass-size relation. The logarithmic DM density slope (α =
d log ρ/d log r) in the central 250-500 pc remains steeper than
α = -0.8 for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass
M⋆ ∼ 106.6 M⊙ and
core-like in the most massive galaxy. In contrast, every SIDM
hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with α {\textgreater}
-0.4. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs
without baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2
baryonic physics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the
inclusion of (potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this
mass scale, suggesting that SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM
using low-mass galaxies. Our FIRE simulations predict that galaxies less
massive than M⋆ ≲ 3 × 106
M⊙ provide potentially ideal targets for discriminating
models, with SIDM producing substantial cores in such tiny galaxies and
CDM producing cusps.},

	abstract = {We present full-sky microwave maps in five frequency bands (23-94 GHz) 
from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year sky
survey. Calibration errors are less than 0.5\%, and the low systematic
error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is
separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps
are consistent with the 7° FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)
maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole
values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with
-58NL{\textless}134 (95\% confidence level [CL]). The
2{\textless}=l{\textless}=900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for
l{\textless}354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to l=658.
The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic
features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical
depth of reionization is τ=0.17+/-0.04, which implies a reionization
epoch of tr=180+220-80 Myr (95\% CL)
after the big bang at a redshift of
zr=20+10-9 (95\% CL) for a range of
ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the
presence of a significant warm dark matter density.

A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of
large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters.
The age of the best-fit universe is t0=13.7+/-0.2 Gyr.
Decoupling was tdec=379+8-7 kyr after
the big bang at a redshift of zdec=1089+/-1. The thickness of
the decoupling surface was Δzdec=195+/-2. The matter
density of the universe is
Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009,
the baryon density is Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009,
and the total mass-energy of the universe is
Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02. It appears that there may be
progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to
fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Lyα
forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of
scalar fluctuations, fitted as ns=0.93+/-0.03 at wavenumber
k0=0.05 Mpc-1 (leff{\textasciitilde}700), with a slope
of dns/dlnk=-0.031+0.016-0.018 in the
best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, ns=0.99+/-0.04.) This
flat universe model is composed of 4.4\% baryons, 22\% dark matter, and
73\% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to
w{\textless}-0.78 (95\% CL). Inflation theory is supported with ns{\textasciitilde}1,
Ωtot{\textasciitilde}1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy,
and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization
anticorrelations at decoupling. An admixture of isocurvature modes does
not improve the fit. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is
r(k0=0.002Mpc-1){\textless}0.90 (95\% CL). The lack of CMB
fluctuation power on the largest angular scales reported by COBE and
confirmed by WMAP is intriguing. WMAP continues to operate, so results
will improve.

WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the
WMAP Science Team.},

We give an overview of the history of Planck in its first year of operations, and describe some of the key performance aspects of the satellite. This paper is part of a package submitted in conjunction with Planck's Early Release Compact Source Catalogue, the first data product based on Planck to be released publicly. The package describes the scientific performance of the Planck payload, and presents results on a variety of astrophysical topics related to the sources included in the Catalogue, as well as selected topics on diffuse emission.
