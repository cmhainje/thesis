	abstract = {The extensive span of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream makes it a promising tool for studying the Milky Way gravitational potential. Characterizing its stellar kinematics can constrain halo properties and provide a benchmark for the Cold Dark Matter galaxy formation paradigm. Accurate models of the disruption dynamics of the Sgr progenitor are necessary to employ this tool. Using a combination of analytic modeling and N-body simulations, we build a new model of the Sgr orbit and resulting stellar stream. In contrast to previous models, we simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time it first crossed the Milky Way virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the parameter space of initial phase-space conditions yields tight constraints on the angular momentum of the Sgr progenitor. Our best-fit model is the first to reproduce accurately existing data on the 3D positions and radial velocities of the debris detected 100 kpc away in the MW halo. In addition to replicating the mapped stream, the simulation also predicts the existence of several arms of the Sgr stream extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs. The two most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo coincide with the predicted structure. Additional stars in the newly predicted arms can be found with future data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Detecting a statistical sample of stars in the most distant Sgr arms would provide an opportunity to constrain the Milky Way potential out to unprecedented Galactocentric radii.},

Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and on the far side of the Galactic Centre, it has not previously been seen because of the large number of foreground stars (in the Milky Way) in that direction. Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them— the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

A special-purpose N-body code is used to construct the first models of the Milky Way-Sgr dwarf system in which both the Milky Way and the Sgr dwarf are represented by full N-body systems and followed for a Hubble time. These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model of the Sgr dwarf's orbit that enables us to explore a wider parameter space than is accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant data on the Sgr dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital histories. At one extreme the Sgr dwarf initially possesses
{\textasciitilde}1011Msolar and starts from a Galactocentric distance RD(0){\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}200kpc. At the other extreme the Sgr dwarf starts with {\textasciitilde}109Msolar and RD(0){\textasciitilde}60kpc, similar to its present apocentric distance. In all cases the Sgr dwarf is initially dark matter dominated and the current velocity dispersion of the Sgr dwarf's dark matter is tightly constrained to be
21+/-2kms-1. This number is probably compatible with the smaller measured dispersion of the Sgr dwarf's stars because of (i) the dynamical difference between dark and luminous matter, and (ii) velocity anisotropy.},

	abstract = {We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy 
mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS). Near-infrared photometry of Sgr's prominent M-giant
population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of Sgr.
The main body is fitted with a King profile of limiting major-axis
radius 30°-substantially larger than previously found or
assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from
stars in the Sgr tidal tails; thus the Sgr radial profile resembles that
of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting traditional
methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the brightness
of the main body of Sgr to be MV=-13.27 (the brightest of the
known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to
be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with
suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the
King-fit core radius (224') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius
as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic
disruption during its last orbits. The M-giant distribution of Sgr
exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to,
the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54. A striking trailing
tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc across the
south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean
distance varying from {\textasciitilde}20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading debris arm
extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an
apogalacticon {\textasciitilde}45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the north
Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the Galactic
plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes, covers the
NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital
plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies within a kiloparsec of
that plane and near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, it is possible
that former Sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood. We discuss
the implications of this new view of the Sgr galaxy and its entrails for
the character of the Sgr orbit, mass, mass-loss rate, and contribution
of stars to the Milky Way halo. The minimal precession displayed by the
Sgr tidal debris along its inclined orbit supports the notion of a
nearly spherical Galactic potential. The number of M giants in the Sgr
tails is at least 15\% that contained within the King limiting radius of
the main Sgr body. The fact that M giants, presumably formed within the
past few gigayears in the Sgr nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread
along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of
these arms but also poses a timing problem that bears on the recent
binding energy of the Sgr core and that is most naturally explained by
recent and catastrophic mass loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than
75\% of the high-latitude, halo M giants, despite substantial reservoirs
of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant
tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good
correspondence is found between the M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr
system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris,
with the exception of Sgr carbon stars, which must be subluminous
compared with counterparts in other Galactic satellites in order to
resolve the discrepancy.},

	abstract = {We present a new N-body model for the tidal disruption of the 
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the
majority of angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints
imposed by current wide-field surveys of its dynamically young (lsim3
Gyr) tidal debris streams. In particular, this model resolves the
conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr
leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years. While
the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the
leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that this
bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the
Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the
success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric
component to the Galactic gravitational potential that can be described
in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio
(c/a)Φ = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio
(b/a)Φ = 0.99 at radii 20 kpc {\textless} r {\textless} 60 kpc. The
minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l,
b) = (7°, 0°), (0°, 90°), and (97°, 0°)
respectively, corresponding to a nearly oblate ellipsoid whose minor
axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. This particular
disk/halo orientation is difficult to reconcile within the general
context of galactic dynamics (and cold dark matter models in
particular), suggesting either that the orientation may have evolved
significantly with time or that inclusion of other non-axisymmetric
components (such as the gravitational influence of the Magellanic
Clouds) in the model may obviate the need for triaxiality in the dark
matter halo. The apparent proper motion of Sgr in this model is
estimated to be (μ l cos b, μ b ) = (-2.16,
1.73) mas yr-1, corresponding to a Galactocentric space
velocity (U, V, W) = (230, -35, 195) km s-1 . Based on the
velocity dispersion in the stellar tidal streams, we estimate that Sgr
has a current bound mass M Sgr = 2.5+1.3
-1.0 × 108 M sun. We demonstrate
that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of Sgr,
tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the
metallicity distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams
similar to those observed in recent studies. These models predict a
strong evolution in the MDF of the model Sgr dwarf with time, indicating
that the chemical abundances of stars in Sgr at the present day may be
significantly different than the abundances of those already contributed
to the Galactic stellar halo. We conclude by using the new N-body model
to re-evaluate previous claims of the association of miscellaneous halo
substructure with the Sgr dwarf.},

Moreover, we show that the internal rotation of the progenitor may strongly alter the location of the leading tail projected on the sky, and thus affect the constraints on the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo that may be derived from modelling the Sgr stream. Our models provide a clear, easily tested prediction; although tidal mass stripping removes a large fraction of the original angular momentum in the progenitor dwarf galaxy, the remnant core should still rotate with a velocity amplitude {\textasciitilde}20kms-1 that could be readily detected in future, wide-field kinematic surveys of the Sgr dwarf.},

in the formation of spiral arms, influences the central bar and produces
a flared outer disk. Two ring-like wrappings emerge towards the Galactic
anti-Centre in our model that are reminiscent of the low-latitude arcs
observed in the same area of the Milky Way. Previous models have focused
on Sgr itself to reproduce the dwarf's orbital history and place
associated constraints on the shape of the Milky Way gravitational
potential, treating the Sgr impact event as a trivial influence on the
Galactic disk. Our results show that the Milky Way's morphology is not

(LMC) could be significantly more massive than previously thought, we
explore whether the approximation of an inertial Galactocentric
reference frame is still valid in the presence of such a massive LMC. We
find that previous estimates of the LMC’s orbital period and
apocentric distance derived assuming a fixed Milky Way (MW) are
significantly shortened for models where the MW is allowed to move
freely in response to the gravitational pull of the LMC. Holding other
parameters fixed, the fraction of models favoring first infall is
reduced. Due to this interaction, the MW center of mass within the inner
50 kpc can be significantly displaced in phase-space in a very short
period of time that ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 Gyr by as much as 30 kpc and
75 km s-1. Furthermore, we show that the gravitational
pull of the LMC and response of the MW are likely to significantly
affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal debris from the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than previous
estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr
deposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the
present-day Sgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly
accounting for the movement of the MW around its common center of mass
with the LMC significantly modifies the angular distance between
apocenters and tilts its orbital pole, alleviating tensions between
previous models and observations. While these models are preliminary in
nature, they highlight the central importance of accounting for the
mutual gravitational interaction between the MW and LMC when modeling
the kinematics of objects in the MW and Local Group.},

For both the leading and the trailing tails, we trace the points of their maximal extent, or apocentric distances, and find that they lie at RL = 47.8 ± 0.5 kpc and
RT = 102.5 ± 2.5 kpc, respectively. The angular
difference between the apocentres is 93.2° ± 3.5°, which
is smaller than predicted for logarithmic haloes. Such differential orbital precession can be made consistent with models of the Milky Way in which the dark matter density falls more quickly with radius. However, currently, no existing Sgr disruption simulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. Based on its position and radial velocity, we show that the unusually large globular cluster NGC 2419 can be associated with the Sgr trailing stream. We measure the precession of the orbital plane of the Sgr debris in the Milky Way potential and show that, surprisingly, Sgr debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolves differently from the secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.},
