	abstract = {It has been suggested that cold dark matter (CDM) has difficulties in explaining tentative evidence for noncuspy halo profiles in small galaxies, and the low velocity dispersions observed in the largest Milky Way satellites ("too big to fail" problem). Strongly self-interacting dark matter has been noted as a robust solution to these problems. The elastic cross sections required are much larger than predicted by generic CDM models, but could naturally be of the right size if dark matter is composite. We explore in a general way the constraints on models where strongly interacting CDM is in the form of dark "atoms" or "molecules," or bound states of a confining gauge interaction ("hadrons"). These constraints include considerations of relic density, direct detection, big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LHC data.},

	abstract = {We review models of new physics in which dark matter arises as a composite bound state from a confining strongly-coupled non-Abelian gauge theory. We discuss several qualitatively distinct classes of composite candidates, including dark mesons, dark baryons, and dark glueballs. We highlight some of the promising strategies for direct detection, especially through dark moments, using the symmetries and properties of the composite description to identify the operators that dominate the interactions of dark matter with matter, as well as dark matter self-interactions. We briefly discuss the implications of these theories at colliders, especially the (potentially novel) phenomenology of dark mesons in various regimes of the models. Throughout the review, we highlight the use of lattice calculations in the study of these strongly-coupled theories, to obtain precise quantitative predictions and new insights into the dynamics.},

We study the dynamics of self-interacting DM via a light mediator, focusing on the quantum resonant regime where the scattering cross section has a non-trivial velocity dependence. While there are long-standing indications that observations of small scale structure in the Universe are not in accord with the predictions of collisionless DM, theoretical study and simulations of DM self-interactions have focused on parameter regimes with simple analytic solutions for the scattering cross section, with constant or classical velocity (and no angular) dependence. We devise a method that allows us to explore the velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are necessary for the achieving the result. We map out the entire parameter space of DM self-interactions --- and implications for structure observations --- as a function of the coupling and the DM and mediator masses. We derive a new analytic formula for describing resonant s-wave scattering. Finally, we show that DM self-interactions can be correlated with observations of Sommerfeld enhancements in DM annihilation through indirect detection experiments.},

	abstract = {Astrophysical observations spanning dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters indicate that dark matter (DM) halos are less dense in their central regions compared to expectations from collisionless DM N-body simulations. Using detailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that self-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit problem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide diversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles varies across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross section as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle physics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross section, from \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 2{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on galaxy scales to \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 0.1{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits from merging clusters. Our results dramatically improve the constraints on SIDM models and may allow the masses of both DM and dark mediator particles to be measured even if the dark sector is completely hidden from the Standard Model, which we illustrate for the dark photon model.},

	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure
observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of ΛCDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density
profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations. We provide a summary and critical look for all current constraints on DM self-interactions and an outline for future directions.},

supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The
distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater}= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0
{\textless} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {\textgreater}= 0.},

universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at
redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8ΩM-0.6ΩΛ{\textasciitilde}-0.2+/-0.1
in the region of interest (ΩM{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.5). For a flat
(ΩM+ΩΛ=1) cosmology we find
ΩflatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 σ statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified
systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Λ=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ{\textgreater}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties.
The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is
tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift
Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

	abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than ∼1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than
∼1011M⊙, the theory faces a number of
challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naïvely predicted in ΛCDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with ΛCDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of ΛCDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the ΛCDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

	abstract = {The lowest luminosity (L {\textless} 105L⊙) Milky Way satellite galaxies represent the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function. These ultra-faint
dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most
metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and
theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns,
structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: In most cases, the stellar velocity
dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic
uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

for M* ∼ 104-11 M⊙ galaxies in
Mh ∼ 109-12 M⊙ haloes. FIRE
incorporates explicit stellar feedback in the multiphase interstellar
medium, with energetics from stellar population models. We find that
stellar feedback, without `fine-tuned' parameters, greatly alleviates
small-scale problems in CDM. Feedback causes bursts of star formation
and outflows, altering the DM distribution. As a result, the inner slope
of the DM halo profile (α) shows a strong mass dependence:
profiles are shallow at Mh ∼
1010-1011 M⊙ and steepen at
higher/lower masses. The resulting core sizes and slopes are consistent
with observations. This is broadly consistent with previous work using
simpler feedback schemes, but we find steeper mass dependence of
α, and relatively late growth of cores. Because the star formation
efficiency M*/Mh is strongly halo mass dependent,
a rapid change in α occurs around Mh ∼
1010 M⊙ (M* ∼
106-107 M⊙), as sufficient feedback
energy becomes available to perturb the DM. Large cores are not
established during the period of rapid growth of haloes because of
ongoing DM mass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of
star formation after the rapid build-up has completed. Stellar feedback
dramatically reduces circular velocities in the inner kpc of massive
dwarfs; this could be sufficient to explain the `Too Big To Fail'
problem without invoking non-standard DM. Finally, feedback and baryonic
contraction in Milky Way-mass haloes produce DM profiles slightly
shallower than the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, consistent with the
normalization of the observed Tully-Fisher relation.},

energetic feedback generates large underdense bubbles of expanding gas from centrally concentrated bursts of star formation. The model
demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation, breaks with the reliance on adiabatic
approximations which are inappropriate in the rapidly changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic fountains can give rise to cusp flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryons form stars. Dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. The model suggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts or active galactic nucleus phases are sufficiently frequent and energetic.},

reduced central densities and flatter cores. We introduce a

For the collisionless case, the overall ellipticity of the cluster, the central density cusp, and the amount of surviving substructure are all similar to those found in earlier high-resolution simulations. Collisional dark matter results in a cluster that is more nearly spherical at all radii, has a steeper central density cusp, and has less-but still
substantial-surviving substructure. As in the collisionless case, these results for a ``fluid'' cluster halo are expected to carry over

compute the cross-section for producing `extreme' arcs of various sizes.
Even a few collisions per particle modifies the core structure enough to
destroy the ability of the cluster to produce long, thin arcs. For
larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to
unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce
giant arcs. None of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except
the `fluid' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with
the smallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit
of observed cluster masses before it produces radial arcs. Apparently
the elastic collision cross-section of dark matter in clusters must be
very small, below 0.1cm2g-1, to be compatible with

The dark matter self-interaction would produce isothermal cores in halos and expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs orbiting in large halos. Another consequence of the model is that halos should become spherical once most particles have interacted. Several observations show that the mass distribution in relaxed clusters of galaxies is elliptical. Here, I discuss in particular gravitational lensing in the cluster MS 2137-23, where the ellipticity of the dark matter distribution can be measured to a small radius, r{\textasciitilde}70 kpc, suggesting that most dark matter particles in clusters outside this radius do not collide during the characteristic age of clusters. If true, this implies that any dark matter self-interaction with a cross section independent of velocity is too weak to have affected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies, or to have facilitated the destruction of dwarf satellites in galactic halos.

collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions and violent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by which clusters grow. Although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size, we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarf galaxies. We find that collision cross sections sufficiently large to significantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores that are too large and/or too round to be

dark-matter haloes from the scales of spiral galaxies to galaxy
clusters, focusing explicitly on models with cross-sections over
dark-matter particle mass σ/m = 1 and 0.1 cm2
g-1. Our simulations rely on a new SIDM N-body algorithm that
is derived self-consistently from the Boltzmann equation and that
reproduces analytic expectations in controlled numerical experiments. We
find that well-resolved SIDM haloes have constant-density cores, with
significantly lower central densities than their cold dark matter (CDM)
counterparts. In contrast, the subhalo content of SIDM haloes is only
modestly reduced compared to CDM, with the suppression greatest for
large hosts and small halo-centric distances. Moreover, the large-scale
clustering and halo circular velocity functions in SIDM are effectively
identical to CDM, meaning that all of the large-scale successes of CDM
are equally well matched by SIDM. From our largest cross-section runs,
we are able to extract scaling relations for core sizes and central
densities over a range of halo sizes and find a strong correlation
between the core radius of an SIDM halo and the NFW scale radius of its
CDM counterpart. We construct a simple analytic model, based on CDM
scaling relations, that captures all aspects of the scaling relations
for SIDM haloes. Our results show that halo core densities in σ/m
= 1 cm2 g-1 models are too low to match
observations of galaxy clusters, low surface brightness spirals (LSBs)
and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. However, SIDM with σ/m ≃ 0.1
cm2 g-1 appears capable of reproducing reported
core sizes and central densities of dwarfs, LSBs and galaxy clusters
without the need for velocity dependence. Higher resolution simulations
over a wider range of masses will be required to confirm this
expectation. We discuss constraints arising from the Bullet cluster
observations, measurements of dark-matter density on small scales and
subhalo survival requirements, and show that SIDM models with σ/m

	abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some
advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},
