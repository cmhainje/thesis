We present a novel study of the Sagittarius (Sgr) tidal stream, investigating
the impacts of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models to determine their
effects on the evolution of this stream. This is done by performing high
resolution simulations of the infall of the Sgr galaxy using CDM and SIDM
models. The resulting streams are analyzed and compared. Comparisons are also
made with observed Sgr candidates from the Gaia DR2 survey.
