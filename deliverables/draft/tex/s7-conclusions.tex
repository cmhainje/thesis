\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this study, we have performed and analyzed high-resolution simulations of the
infall of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy into the Milky
Way (MW), considering the properties of the resulting Sgr tidal stream. These
analyses have been performed using both cold dark matter (CDM) and
self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models to determine where self-interaction
has a strong impact on the the evolution of the stream and thereby potentially
an effect on the viability of SIDM itself. We have also compared our resulting
simulated Sgr streams to observed Sgr candidates from the Gaia DR2 survey.

\textit{%
    When studies are completed, this section will be fleshed out more greatly to
    reflect specific discoveries made regarding the differences between the
    CDM and SIDM streams and their similarity to data.
