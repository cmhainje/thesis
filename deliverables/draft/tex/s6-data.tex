\chapter{Comparison to Gaia data}
\label{sec:data}

In this section, I will compare my simulation results for both the CDM and SIDM
evolved streams to data. In particular, I intend to compare the snapshots
featuring the Sgr most similar to today (determined via observable coordinates)
to Sgr candidates from the Gaia DR2 survey as identified
by~\cite{ibata_panoramic_2020}. This will involve the comparison of stream
properties, observable coordinates, and more, wherever possible. Without the
SIDM runs completed, however, there is little more that can be discussed at this
time.
