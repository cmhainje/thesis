We perform a series of controlled N-body simulations to study impacts of the dissipative interactions on halo properties. The interplay between gravitational contraction and collisional dissipation can significantly speed up the onset of gravothermal collapse, resulting in a steep inner density profile. For reasonable choices of model parameters controlling the dissipation, the collapse timescale can be a factor of 10-100 shorter than that predicted in purely elastic self-interacting dark matter. The effect is maximized when energy loss per collision is comparable to characteristic kinetic energy of dark matter particles in the halo. Our simulations provide guidance for testing the dissipative nature of dark matter with astrophysical observations.},

Characterizing its stellar kinematics can constrain halo properties and provide a benchmark for the Cold Dark Matter galaxy formation paradigm. Accurate models of the disruption dynamics of the Sgr progenitor are necessary to employ this tool. Using a combination of analytic modeling and N-body simulations, we build a new model of the Sgr orbit and resulting stellar stream. In contrast to previous models, we simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time it first crossed the Milky Way virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the parameter space of initial phase-space conditions yields tight constraints on the angular momentum of the Sgr progenitor. Our best-fit model is the first to reproduce accurately existing data on the 3D positions and radial velocities of the debris detected 100 kpc away in the MW halo. In addition to replicating the mapped stream, the simulation also predicts the existence of several arms of the Sgr stream extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs. The two most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo coincide with the predicted structure. Additional stars in the newly predicted arms can be found with future data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Detecting a statistical sample of stars in the most distant Sgr arms would provide an opportunity to constrain the Milky Way potential out to unprecedented Galactocentric radii.},

	abstract = {We present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas disks based on the assumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

	abstract = {We review theories of dark matter (DM) beyond the collisionless paradigm, known as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and their observable implications for astrophysical structure in the Universe. Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations. We provide a summary and critical look for all current constraints on DM self-interactions and an outline for future directions.},

Strongly self-interacting dark matter has been noted as a robust solution to these problems. The elastic cross sections required are much larger than predicted by generic CDM models, but could naturally be of the right size if dark matter is composite. We explore in a general way the constraints on models where strongly interacting CDM is in the form of dark "atoms" or "molecules," or bound states of a confining gauge interaction ("hadrons"). These constraints include considerations of relic density, direct detection, big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LHC data.},

We study the dynamics of self-interacting DM via a light mediator, focusing on the quantum resonant regime where the scattering cross section has a non-trivial velocity dependence. While there are long-standing indications that observations of small scale structure in the Universe are not in accord with the predictions of collisionless DM, theoretical study and simulations of DM self-interactions have focused on parameter regimes with simple analytic solutions for the scattering cross section, with constant or classical velocity (and no angular) dependence. We devise a method that allows us to explore the velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are necessary for the achieving the result. We map out the entire parameter space of DM self-interactions --- and implications for structure observations --- as a function of the coupling and the DM and mediator masses. We derive a new analytic formula for describing resonant s-wave scattering. Finally, we show that DM self-interactions can be correlated with observations of Sommerfeld enhancements in DM annihilation through indirect detection experiments.},

Conversely, SIDM simulations using a Monte Carlo N-body technique produce halos with significantly reduced central densities and flatter cores with increasing cross section. We introduce a concentration parameter based on enclosed mass that we expect will be straightforward to determine observationally, unlike that of Navarro, Frenk \& White, and provide predictions for SIDM and CDM. SIDM also produces more spherical halos than CDM, providing possibly the strongest observational test of SIDM. We discuss our findings in relation to various relevant observations as well as SIDM simulations of other groups. Taking proper account of simulation limitations, we find that a dark matter cross section per unit mass of sigma\_DM {\textasciitilde}= 10{\textasciicircum}\{-23\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{-24\} cm{\textasciicircum}2/GeV is consistent with all current observational constraints.},

Using detailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that self-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit problem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide diversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles varies across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross section as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle physics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross section, from \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 2{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on galaxy scales to \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textbackslash}simeq 0.1{\textbackslash}; \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\}\$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits from merging clusters.

We test the code by evolving a pair of simple gas disc-halo models, which differ only in the initial temperature of the gas component. The models are similar to the ones considered in the Wang et al. except that here, the halo is live whereas they included the halo as a fixed potential. We find that the basic structural properties of the models, such as the rotation curve and surface density profiles, are well-preserved over 1.5 Gyr. We also construct a Milky Way model that includes thin and thick stellar disc components, a gas disc, a bulge, and a dark halo. Bar formation occurs in all disc-like components at about 1 Gyr. The bar is strongest in the thin disc while the gas disc contains the most prominent spiral features.

	abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity \& cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' \& numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, \& sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors \& numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates placing them within 3Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current on-line resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW and M31 subgroups and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and sub-groups is discussed, and time-scales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible floor in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

Traditional attempts to understand the Galaxy's morphology assume that it has been unperturbed by major external forces. Here we report simulations of the response of the Milky Way to the infall of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), which results in the formation of spiral arms, influences the central bar and produces a flared outer disk. Two ring-like wrappings emerge towards the Galactic anti-Center in our model that are reminiscent of the low- latitude arcs observed in the same area of the Milky Way. Previous models have focused on Sgr itself to reproduce the dwarf's orbital history and place associated constraints on the shape of the Milky Way gravitational potential, treating the Sgr impact event as a trivial influence on the Galactic disk. Our results show that the Milky Way's morphology is not purely secular in origin and that low-mass minor mergers predicted to be common throughout the Universe probably have a similarly important role in shaping galactic structure.},

In particular, this model resolves the conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years. While the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that this bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric component to the Galactic gravitational potential which can be described in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio (c/a)\_Phi = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio (b/a)\_Phi = 0.99 at radii 20 {\textless} r {\textless} 60 kpc. The minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l, b) = (7, 0), (0, 90), and (97, 0) respectively, corresponding to a nearly-oblate ellipsoid whose minor axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. We demonstrate that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of Sgr, tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the metallicity distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams similar to those observed in recent studies.

A special-purpose N-body code is used to construct the first models of the Milky Way - Sgr Dwarf system in which both the Milky Way and the Sgr Dwarf are represented by full N-body systems and followed for a Hubble time. These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model of the Dwarf's orbit that enable us to explore a wider parameter space than is accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant data on the Dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital histories. At one extreme the Dwarf initially possesses 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Solar Mass and starts from a Galactocentric distance 200 kpc. At the other extreme the Dwarf starts with 10{\textasciicircum}9 Solar Mass and Galactocentric distance 60 kpc, similar to its present apocentric distance. In all cases the Dwarf is initially dark-matter dominated and the current velocity dispersion of the Dwarf's dark matter is tightly constrained to be 21 km/s. This number is probably compatible with the smaller measured dispersion of the Dwarf's stars because of (a) the dynamical difference between dark and luminous matter, and (b) velocity anisotropy.},

These cosmological zoom-in simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and utilize the FIRE-2 model for hydrodynamics and galaxy formation physics. We find the stellar masses of the galaxies formed in Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) with \${\textbackslash}sigma/m= 1{\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}2/g\$ are very similar to those in CDM (spanning \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{5.7 - 7.0\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) and all runs lie on a similar stellar mass -- size relation. The logarithmic dark matter density slope (\${\textbackslash}alpha=d{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}rho / d{\textbackslash}log r\$) in the central \$250-500\$ pc remains steeper than \${\textbackslash}alpha= -0.8\$ for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{6.6\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and core-like in the most massive galaxy. In contrast, every SIDM hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textgreater}-0.4\$. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs without baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2 baryonic physics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the inclusion of (potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this mass scale, suggesting SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM using low-mass galaxies. Our FIRE simulations predict that galaxies less massive than \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textless} 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ provide potentially ideal targets for discriminating models, with SIDM producing substantial cores in such tiny galaxies and CDM producing cusps.},

The model is specified by a phase space distribution function which, in turn, depends on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 10{\textasciicircum}5 models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability distribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the Sersic index of the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We also calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter velocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for terrestrial dark matter detection experiments. Though the Milky Way models in our chain all satisfy the prescribed observational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters and therefore respond differently to non-axisymmetric perturbations. We simulate the evolution of twenty-five models which have different Toomre Q and Goldreich-Tremaine X parameters. Virtually all of these models form a bar, though some, more quickly than others. The bar pattern speeds are {\textasciitilde} 40 - 50 km/s/kpc at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to coupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed {\textasciitilde}50 km/s/kpc we conclude that it must have formed recently.},

	abstract = {We present the first full six-dimensional panoramic portrait of the Sagittarius stream, obtained by searching for wide stellar streams in the Gaia DR2 dataset with the STREAMFINDER algorithm. We use the kinematic behavior of the sample to devise a selection of Gaia RR Lyrae, providing excellent distance measurements along the stream. The proper motion data are complemented with radial velocities from public surveys. We find that the global morphological and kinematic properties of the Sagittarius stream are still reasonably well reproduced by the simple Law \& Majewski (2010) model (LM10), although the model overestimates the leading arm and trailing arm distances by up to \${\textbackslash}sim 15\$\%. The sample newly reveals the leading arm of the Sagittarius stream as it passes into very crowded regions of the Galactic disk towards the Galactic Anticenter direction. Fortuitously, this part of the stream is almost exactly at the diametrically opposite location from the Galactic Center to the progenitor, which should allow an assessment of the influence of dynamical friction and self-gravity in a way that is nearly independent of the underlying Galactic potential model.},
